# 🧵 SpoolStack

**Self-Hosted 3D Printing Filament Inventory Tracker**

SpoolStack is a clean, self-hosted web app for tracking your 3D printing filament spools. It comes pre-loaded with the Bambu Lab color catalog and lets you manage your inventory with filtering, search, and sorting.

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- **🗂️ Spool Inventory**: Add, edit, and delete filament spools with brand, material, color, weight, price, and status tracking
- **🎨 Color Catalog**: Pre-loaded Bambu Lab color catalog with hex swatches for quick spool entry
- **🔍 Filtering & Search**: Filter by status, brand, material, or modifier. Full-text search across all spool fields
- **🔃 Sorting**: Sort by date added, material, color family, or brand

### Configuration & Management
- **⚙️ Settings Panel**: Manage brands, materials, modifiers, and color catalogs without touching the database directly
- **🏷️ Custom Brands & Colors**: Add your own brands and colors through the Settings UI
- **💾 Local Storage**: Data stored in a local SQLite file — no external database needed

### Design & Architecture
- **🚀 Server Actions**: Fast, type-safe mutations with Next.js Server Actions
- **✅ Validation**: Schema-level validation with Zod
- **🛠️ Type Safety**: Full TypeScript throughout the stack

## 📋 Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm

## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker)

The easiest way to run this is with Docker.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ijoshi129/spoolstack
cd spoolstack
docker compose up -d
```

That's it. Open `http://<your-server-ip>:3000`.

The database is created and seeded automatically on first launch. Data is stored in a Docker volume (`filament-data`) so it persists across container restarts and rebuilds.

### Updating

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

Your data is safe — the database only gets created on first run.

## 🛠️ Local Development

### Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run db:setup   # creates tables + seeds Bambu Lab color catalog
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

### Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm start` | Start production server |
